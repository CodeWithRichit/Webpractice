        <img src="https://www.cookwithmanali.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Best-Kadai-Paneer-Recipe.jpg" alt="Plate"
            width="270px">
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <p>Rinse the paneer in water twice and soak it in hot water for at least 15 to 20 minutes. Soaking in hot water
            will make the paneer super soft.
            Dry roast the ingredients mentioned in the 'Masala powder' on medium flame till aromatic.
            Cool the spice mix and grind to a slightly coarse powder
            Cut the bell peppers in cubes after removing all the seeds in cut. Similarly cube the onions (1 medium size)
            and separate all the onion layers. In a kadai, add 2 tablespoon oil and on high flame sauté the onion cubes
            for 2 minutes. Add the bell pepper cubes as well and sauté for another 2 to 3 minutes. Do not overcook the
            bell peppers and onions, as they must remain crunchy.
            Now add some salt and around tablespoon of the roasted ground masala and toss. Transfer the onions and bell
            peppers to a plate and keep aside.

        <h2>(3)Daal Chawal</h2>

        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <p>Wash and soak the arhar dal for 30 mins.Then boil the dal with 3 cups of water, salt and haldi. If using
            pressure cooker then 3 whistles. Let the pressure release on its own. Adjust the consistency right now. If
            too thick add some water and boil for another 5 minutes or if too thin then boil further till desired
            consistency is reached.
            Cover and keep aside.
            To make the tadka, in a kadai, add hing, jeera, chopped ginger and garlic. Sauté till the rawness
            disappears.
            Add chopped onions, green chillies, lightly brown them.
            Now add salt, haldi (little bit as allready added while boiling) and red chilly powder and immediately add
            chopped tomatoes. Cook till the tomatoes are soft and tender. This will take around 5 mins.
            Tip in the boiled dal to this , add crushed kasoori methi. Cover the vessel and bring to boil. Keep the lid
            closed so that the aroma of the tadka sweeps through the dal.
            Alternatively pour the tadka on the dal in the pressure cooker itself and close the lid till further use.
            To make boiled rice:
            Wash the rice in water 2 – 3 times running your fingers through it. This will remove excess starch from the
            rice. This will turn the water milk. Keep throwing the water. Removing extra starch from the rice ensures
            that the rice don not get sticky and will turn out fluffy. After the final rinse soak the rice for 30 mins.
            In a large pan having a capacity of 2 – 3 litre, boil the water.
            Once the water starts to boil add 1 tsp Salt and 1 tsp Oil. It is important that the water is boiling before
            you add the rice.
            Add the soaked rice. Do NOT add the water in which the rice were soaked.
            Give the rice a gentle stir. And let them boil for 8 – 10 mins. Check if the rice is got soft and then drain
            the extra water in a strainer leaving the rice behind.</p>
