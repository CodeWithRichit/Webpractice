    <pre>Featured articles are considered to be the best articles in Wikipedia, as determined by Wikipedia's editors. The featured short articles listed here are those with fewer than 1,000 words. Before being listed, articles are reviewed at Wikipedia:Featured short article candidates for accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style according to our featured article criteria. Featured short articles must meet all of the criteria in the same way as the longer featured articles, although research and data are often more limited for those listed here. Articles that no longer meet the criteria can be proposed for improvement or removal at Wikipedia:Featured article review.

A small bronze star (This star symbolizes the featured content on Wikipedia.) on the top right corner of an article's page indicates for non-logged-in readers and most user settings that the article is featured. Additionally, if the current article is featured in another language version, a star will appear next to the language page link, in the list on the left of the page (see also Wikipedia:Featured articles in other languages).</pre>
